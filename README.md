# XD75RE Universal Layout

![XD75RE Keyboard](images/Keyboard.JPG)

Keyboard layout for [XD75RE](https://kprepublic.com/products/xd75re-xd75am-xd75-xiudi-60-custom-keyboard-pcb) ortholinear mechanical keyboard.

I had been using [Universal Layout](https://github.com/braindefender/universal-layout) for years now 
and wanted to push the limit of my keyboard experience with ortholinear XD75RE.

The main purpose of Universal Layout was logical arrangement of similar symbols (e.g. <kbd>'</kbd>, <kbd>"</kbd>, <kbd>\`</kbd>) in one place
and preserving positions of symbols in both English and Russian layouts.

In this layout I combined the main advantages of Universal Layout and spice it up with new features like vim arrows, numpad-switching and media controls.

You will be guided through this article by the mascot of Universal Layout ‚Äî Symbot!

**Key differences from traditional layout:**

- Keyboard split into three parts with Numpad/Arrow block in center.
- Keys with <kbd>,;</kbd> and <kbd>.:</kbd> are placed separately from both sides of <kbd>Space</kbd>.
- All common symbols are gathered in one key. Such as quotes, slashes and dashes.
- Numeric row has been swapped with symbols: to type number use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + symbol, e.g. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>@</kbd> = <kbd>2</kbd>.

## Layer One

## Layer Two

This layer are similar to Layer One, but Numpad is placed on Fn Layer. 
Quotes and slashes are moved closer to the center of keyboard.
I personally like vim arrows and media shortcuts in the Fn Layer.

## Alt Layer

Alt Layer contains some symbols for currency, math, arrows and rare letters. 
Keys that combine similar symbols (like quotes and slashes) are also powered by this layer.

## Installation

1. Copy `.dll` from `sources` folder to `C:/Windows/System 32`.
2. Run `.reg` files and reboot the system (or logout / login).
3. Select layout in `Preferences / Language and Region / Language`.

## Known issues

For some reason Windows 10 occasionally changes layout back to default English or Russian layout.

To prevent this behaviour you could rename `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts` 
registry entry named `00000409` and `00000419` to something else (e.g `00000409` ‚Üí `00000409-off`).

But it is a temporary fix and may break keyboard behaviour in some applications. Full impact is unknown and not tested by me.
